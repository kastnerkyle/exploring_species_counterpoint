Experiments in species counterpoint

Implementing rules from "The Study of Counterpoint", from Johann Joseph Fux's "Gradus Ad Parnassum", translated by Alfred Mann

We don't follow all the rules (a lot are violable, and are more preferences than true rules), but a large subset + strong checking

Including workbook from www.ianstoner.com/pdf/fux\_workbook\_0.1.pdf
